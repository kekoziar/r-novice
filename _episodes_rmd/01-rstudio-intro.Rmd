Welcome to the R deep dive, or I should say shallow wade because R is a pretty big 
topic, and we won’t get far in the time we have.  I am following a modified 
Carpentries lesson that will introduce R and RStudio, how to work in 
R to read, store, manipulate, and save data. 

## Introduction to R and RStudio
Welcome to R.  First, what is R?  What is RStudio?  And, How are they different?
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and 
graphics. It is free, and supported by the R Foundation. RStudio is a free, open source
IDE (or integrated development environment) for R. 
RStudio basically provides a nicer interface to develop in R. RStudio also
has other advantages such as integration with version control and project management.

Throughout this lesson, we’re going to teach you some of the fundamentals of the R 
language as well as some best practices for organizing coding projects 
that will make your life easier.

## Navigating RStudio

**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. 

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to a shell or command line environment: it 
operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:


~~~
1 + 100
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 101
~~~
{: .output}

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

Let's do another simple calculation, one plus... 

Oops, I accidentally hit the enter key and, now what we see is the plus sign instead of a 
greater than symbol. 

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

The plus sign means R is waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can simply hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the ">"
prompt.

> ## Tip: Cancelling commands
>
> If you're using R from the commandline instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>
> to cancel the command. This applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.
>
{: .callout}

While math is fun, it's more fun to make the math reproducable, and in order to do that we need to 
start using variables.  

## Variables and assignment

We store values in variables using the assignment operator, which looks like an arrow pointing to the left `<-`:


~~~
demonstration_variable <- 1/40
~~~
{: .language-r}

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, it is stored for later
use. `demonstration_variable` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

If you look at the `Environment` tab in the top right panes, you will see  `demonstration_variable` 
and its value have appeared. And we can show output of `demonstration_variable` by typing it in the console:

~~~
demonstration_variable
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
[1] 0.025
~~~
{: .output}

Now, `demonstration_variable` seems like a very long variable name, but the nice thing about R and RStudio, 
is it uses tab complete. This means, I can start typing the first few letters, and it will complete the 
variable name when I press the tab key.  This is important, because variable names should be descriptive.
I could just use a variable name of `x`, but that's not very descriptive of what the variable actually represents.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.



Back to our variable `demonstration_variable`.  
Variables can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:

~~~
log(demonstration_variable)
~~~
{: .language-r}


~~~
[1] -3.688879
~~~
{: .output}

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:


~~~
demonstration_variable <- 100000
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
[1] 1e+05
~~~
{: .output}

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `1e05`
is shorthand for `1 * 10^(5)`. You can also write and assign to variables numbers 
in scientific notation

~~~
mol<-6.022e23
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
[1] 6.022e+23
~~~
{: .output}

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:


~~~
demonstration_variable <- demonstration_variable + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- demonstration_variable * 2
~~~
{: .language-r}

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:


~~~
demonstration_variable = 1/40
~~~
{: .language-r}

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

{: .challenge}

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and
mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the 
same data type. For example


~~~
1:5
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
x <- 1:5
2^x
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
[1]  2  4  8 16 32
~~~
{: .output}

You can also use the combine function `c()` to combine items separated by commas.

~~~
x <- c(1:5, 10:15)
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
[1]  1  2  3  4  5 10 11 12 13 14 15
~~~
{: .output}


This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.

## Saving Your Code

The console is nice to work out and test single lines of code, but for you need a place
to save your code, and that would be in a script file.  
Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png)


## Setting Up Your Workspace
A good first line for your script is to set the working directory of the script to the 
project folder.  This will allow you to access your data and print results using a 
relational path instead of an absolute one.  This also helps your code become portable, 
and sharable. 

The first thing I am going to do is navigate to the directory where I want my project.

Now, I will add to our script file `setwd("~/Desktop/IntroToR")`

To save the file, I click `ctrl+s` and it prompts me to find a place to save it.  
Navigating to the project folder, I'm going to add a few folders before I save it.
`data` will contain all my data, `results` will contain results, and `src` will contain source 
files.

Once you're in an .R file, you can use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command
to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console. Put the cursor on the line of code you want to run, or select 
the lines of code, and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux 
or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 
> 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or 
> 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 
> 3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux 
> or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
> (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselect the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.
