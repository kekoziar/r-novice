*An introduction to R for non-programmers using gapminder data*

Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and collected
data, the real fun begins! This lesson will teach you how to start this process using
R and RStudio. We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
how to plot results graphically. This example starts with a dataset containing population 
information for many countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the 
population for Senegal? Can you calculate the average income for countries on the continent of Asia?
By the end of this lesson you will be able to do things like plot the populations
for all of these countries in under a minute!

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code
and best practices for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many
scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party
packages. We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops
use R and want to learn more. The emphasis of these materials is to give
attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best
practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units,
task automation, and encapsulation.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the
programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.

The lesson contains more material than can be taught in a day.  The 
[instructor notes page]({{ page.root }}/guide) has some suggested lesson plans suitable for a one or 
half day workshop.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files.
> Files are organised in directories (folders).
> Know how to access files not in the working directory by specifying the path.
